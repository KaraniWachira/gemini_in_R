## Introduction

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications straight from R.![](images/example_shiny.gif)

*example of a shiny application*

## Agenda

-   Integrate Google's Gemini AI Model into R: chat bot assitant

-   To build a Shiny application that combines the power of images and text prompts.

-   We'll explore how this application leverages an Gemini API to generate creative text descriptions based on uploaded images and user-provided prompts.

## Getting started

[ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket) install shiny package

``` r
install.packages("shiny")
```

[ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket) load shiny

``` r
library(shiny)
```

[ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket) start the app

``` r
runApp("my_app")
```

shiny comes with bslib R package provides a modern UI toolkit for Shiny and R Markdown based on Bootstrap.

[bslib package documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/index.html)

## Structure of a shiny app

shiny apps have three components:

1.  a user interface object: controls the layout and appearance of the application

<!-- -->

2.  a server function: contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your app

3.  a call to the shiny app function

## Terminologies Related to Gemini API

-   Prompt: A question you want to ask?

-   Token: sub words or words e.g. the word "unhappy" splits into "un" and "happy"

-   Temperature: model parameter used to fine tune the response and it lies between 0 and 1.

    > close to 0 value means model generate response which has highest probability while a value closer to 1 will produce responses that are more creative

-   Max output tokens: defines the max number of token that can be generated in the response

## Packages we will use

-   bslib() : The `bslib` R package provides a modern UI toolkit for Shiny based on Boostrap, Creation of delightful and customizable shiny apps, custome theming etc

-   gemini.R package : uses the gemini_image() to send to Gemini server and return results
